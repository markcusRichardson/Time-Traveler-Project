‚è≥ Time Traveler Project

Welcome to **Time Traveler Project**, a Python program I developed as part of the **Modules section** in my **Python 3 course on Codecademy. 
This project demonstrates how to work with date and time manipulation using Python's built-in datetime module.

About This Project
This project allows users to **"travel through time"** by calculating past or future dates based on user input. It serves as a practical exercise in:
- Using the `datetime` module** to manipulate dates.
- Creating reusable functions** in Python.
- Handling user input** with interactive CLI applications.
